    <h3>Forest Game Unreal Project</h3>
    <p>This interactive experience was crafted using Unreal Engine 5.2.1, featuring the incorporation of the PCG plugin for environmental elements. The forest floor was enhanced using the Quixel Bridge Megascane asset. Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into animation techniques and diverse game structuring approaches. The game boasts a stamina system, dynamic day-night transitions, and immersive 3D audio. To add an extra layer of challenge, AI enemies are strategically placed within the scene to engage and challenge the player. Additionally, the Sequencer tool was employed to create a captivating win-game moment.
